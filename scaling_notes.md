## Three points define a scale

The scale in __defined__ as a continuum with a normal distribution as a metric (did they read Schwartz by the way?), two points are not enough for defining a bell shape because the top of the bell may be between the points or otside the segment between the points. Three points on another side are fully defining the curve. The higher dimension case is more interesting, but it follows the same general principle: the maximum of a bell-shaped curve is 'between' the points or outside the body delineated by the straight lines connecting the closest points.
