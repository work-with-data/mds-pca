# Roger Shepard did not invent 'Multidimensional Scaling'

In his two-part 1962 article he presented an algorithm performing the Multidimensional Scaling (in part I) and gave several examples of its application (in Part II).

The real inventor was:

Warren S. Torgerson, __*A THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL rNVESTIGATION OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING*__, Ph.D. Thesis, Prin~eton University 1951.
