Young and Householder's test to determine the dimensionality

We have here again a very useful numbering system, since from the six double coordinates and the appropriate operation of vector subtraction we can calculate each of the I5 experimental distances, or predict the percentage of persons who will judge one offense more serious than the other. New points may be added to the system without disturbing the numbering system of the old set. This is another way of saying that this type of scale has advantages beyond the ordinal scale. Likewise, the scale is completely self-contained with a twodimensional, instead of a one-dimensional, check of internal consistency.
